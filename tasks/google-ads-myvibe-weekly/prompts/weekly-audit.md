## Conversion Quality Framework

### MyVibe Conversion Funnel
1. **Signup** (primary conversion) - $2 target CPA
2. **Email Verified** (quality signal)
3. **First Vibe Created** (engagement)
4. **First Vibe Published** (activation)
5. **Paid Upgrade** (revenue)

### Quality Scoring
- Bounce rate > 80% from ad = bad traffic source
- Time on site < 30s = low quality
- No activation in 7 days = low intent

## Decision Framework

### When to PAUSE
- Keyword: 2x CPA target with 20+ clicks, 0 conversions
- Ad: CTR < 0.5% after 1000 impressions
- Campaign: CPA > 3x target after learning period

### When to SCALE
- Keyword: CPA < target with 10+ conversions
- Ad: CTR > 2% and conversion rate > 3%
- Campaign: Consistent CPA at target, not budget limited

### When to TEST
- Weekly: 2-3 new headlines
