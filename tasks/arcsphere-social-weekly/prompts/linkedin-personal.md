Excited to share what we've been working on: ArcSphere 1.10

Two features I'm particularly proud of:

**Share Extension**
No more copy-paste workflows. Share anything directly to your AI navigator.

**WPA Desktop Icons**
Launch your favorite AI tools like native apps.

These might seem like small improvements, but they represent something bigger: making AI accessible from anywhere, anytime.

What features matter most to you in an AI browser? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
